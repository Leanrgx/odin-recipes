        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs in a bowl that's about th size of the chicken breasts and 
                stir them vigorously</li>
            <li>Put a bed of bread crumbs in a plate or pan where the chicken can lay comfortably</li>

            <li>Add salt, pepper and the parsley to the beaten eggs</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken breasts into thin slices</li>
            <li>Submerge the chicken in the egg and then place it on the bread bed. Flip it and make sure that the bread
                covers the entirety of the chicken
            </li>
            <li>Heat up a pan with oil. Use a little bit of bread crumbs to check when the oil is ready for the chicken.
                You can tell it's ready when the crumbs start making bubbles instead of sinking
            </li>
            <li>Place the milanesa in the oil, leave it for a few minutes then flip. It will be ready when they turn a nice golden brown color.</li>
